# ToDoList

This a very simple To Do List made in Angular (and Bootstrap 4). 
I'm currently (April '21) learning this JS framework, so I decided to practice a little bit with it before moving forward in Angular territory.

To open just clone the repository and, using the angular CLI, execute the command "ng serve" after being on the "app" directory.
